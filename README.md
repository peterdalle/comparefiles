# comparefiles

Search for identical files of a given file extension in the current directory and all its subdirectories.

The program calculates a MD5 hash for each file. Files that have an identical hash are then presented on the screen.

Note: the program is very slow when there is a large number of files (due to `n * n` lookups).

## Usage

```bash
$ python comparefiles.py [file extension] [folder]
```

If folder is not set, the current folders is searched.

## Example

The following will search for all `.sav` files in current directory and all subdirectories.

```bash
$ python comparefiles.py .sav
```

Which outputs the following:

```
Searched 29 .sav file(s) in all subdirectories
